# Current project:
[Web Application for Running Machine Learning Algorithms](https://thegospeler-powerdsmlwebapp-powerml-yry4t9.streamlit.app/)

Previous Project
[Exploring the Tetouan Power Consumption Dataset!](https://thegospeler-webapps-powerds-ml-m24fel.streamlit.app/)

I am currently building a web application using the Tetouan Power Consumption Dataset obtained from the UCI repository. 
The application enables the user to fully explore the Dataset by visualizing the relationship between the features (weather parameters with the resulting power consumption in three city zones) in the dataset using two-dimensional interactions with multiselection options and multidimensional interactions using Altair plots and HiPlots, respectively.

This is the initial stage of the project!
The second stage will involve machine learning capabilities to predict power consumption based on the available features. I am excited and looking forward to the completion of the application. Meanwhile, make sure you click on the link to explore the dataset.
Cheers!
